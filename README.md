1/- No, putting all functions in a single service class is not recommended :Placing all functionalities in a single service violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by combining user management, room configuration, and booking logic in one class. This leads to more complex, less readable code that becomes harder to maintain and test as the application grows.

2/- To make sure the setRoom() function doesn't affect existing bookings, it's important to separate responsibilities using clean design. For example, we can create an interface like IService to handle room updates independently from the booking system.
