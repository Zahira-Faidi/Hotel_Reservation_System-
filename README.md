1/- No, putting all functions in a single service class is not recommended :Placing all functionalities in a single service violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by combining user management, room configuration, and booking logic in one class. This leads to more complex, less readable code that becomes harder to maintain and test as the application grows.

2/- The setRoom(...) function does not affect existing bookings because bookings are historical records that must remain unchanged to preserve data integrity and respect what the user agreed to at the time. Changing them could cause legal issues and complex logic like recalculating balances or issuing refunds. A better approach is to save the room's type and price inside the booking when it is created, so future changes to the room do not impact past bookings.
